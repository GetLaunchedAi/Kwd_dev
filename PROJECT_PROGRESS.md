# Project Progress: ClickUp to Cursor Workflow Tool

## Project Goal

Automated workflow tool that receives ClickUp tasks via webhooks, triggers Cursor's agent to make code changes, runs tests, and manages approval workflow before pushing to GitHub.

## Features Implemented/Planned

- Receives ClickUp webhooks for task status changes
- Automatically finds and opens client website folders
- Triggers Cursor agent to make code changes
- Runs automated tests
- Sends approval notifications via email/Slack
- Pushes approved changes to GitHub

## Current Progress

We have successfully initiated the project setup and cleared out old task-related markdown files from the root directory to maintain a clean workspace. The workflow is in its early stages of development, with the core structure being established. Specific tasks, such as 'button testing' and 'accessibility analysis', have been completed, and their corresponding documentation files have been removed.

Further development will focus on integrating ClickUp webhooks, triggering the Cursor agent for code changes, and implementing automated testing and approval workflows.
